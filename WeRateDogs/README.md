# Data Wrangling Project 


## Introduction 

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and emailed it to Udacity exclusively to use in this project. It contains basic data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) extracted from 2356 of the 5000+ tweets from the @dog_rates twitter account, posted between November 15, 2015 and August 1, 2017. 


## Project steps Overview
With the main focus of this project being on data wrangling, it will be divided into the following steps:

1. Data wrangling  
      - Data Gathering
      - Data Assessing
      - Data Cleaning 
      - Storing Data

2. Analyzing and visualizing data
3. Reporting

## Goal

The project is about wrangling, analysing and visualizing data from various sources.
One is presented as a csv file containing information about text tweet, timestemp,tweet replies and retweets and ratings, a tsv file containing information about tweet id, image url and predictions of dog breed and a text file creating after scrapping favoriate and retweet counts from a tweet using the tweet id with the help of the python's library tweepy and twitter's API.
